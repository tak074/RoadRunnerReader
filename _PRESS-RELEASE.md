# RoadRunnerReader
Displays entire text one word at a time at a fast interval to boost one's reading speed.

### Summary
This product is for those who wishes to uptain knowledge at a faster rate. Slower readers have a disadvantage when it comes to learning through reading, and this app aims to abridge such a disadvantage. User can upload a text of their choice, and have it displayed to them at a rapid pace that is still comprehensible. The user can adjust the speed of the display and as well as pause/start.

### Problem
Slow readers takes longer time to read due to their untrained eyes, and their slow information uptake may serve as a distraction or be unproductive as their reading speed may be slower than the short term memory duration.

### Solution
By allowing words to move instead of your own eye, one can read at a faster rate. Also, this app's ability to pause/start gives users options to take breaks, and customizability allows users to find the optimal speed to push themselves at.
