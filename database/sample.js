export let story = `Ocean Cockle looked at the peculiar hawk in her hands and felt irritable.

She walked over to the window and reflected on her quiet surroundings. She had always loved backward West Boggins with its grubby, grotesque gates. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel irritable.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Tristan Snozcumber. Tristan was a smart teacher with ugly spots and charming moles.

Ocean gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a kind, rude, cocoa drinker with fat spots and pretty moles. Her friends saw her as a dirty, delicious deity. Once, she had even saved a loopy kitten that was stuck in a drain.

But not even a kind person who had once saved a loopy kitten that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what Tristan had in store today.

The snow flurried like talking frogs, making Ocean barmy.

As Ocean stepped outside and Tristan came closer, she could see the black smile on his face.

Tristan gazed with the affection of 1431 popular gentle gerbils. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want equality."

Ocean looked back, even more barmy and still fingering the peculiar hawk. "Tristan, what's up Doc," she replied.

They looked at each other with angry feelings, like two different, dangerous donkeys singing at a very optimistic wedding, which had flute music playing in the background and two smelly uncles jumping to the beat.

Ocean regarded Tristan's ugly spots and charming moles. "I feel the same way!" revealed Ocean with a delighted grin.

Tristan looked sad, his emotions blushing like a tired, thoughtful torch.

Then Tristan came inside for a nice mug of cocoa.
